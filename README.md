***Because
it was submitted before the due time, please consider of marking it as such.***

**Basic
Background:** My
name is Andrew Dauven from Gen Z and I am a Queenslander, so I am from the
Sunshine state essentially. The best state to be even though I am studying
online with RMIT University.

I
have prior experience in software development and have been used to languages
like C#, Java, Javascript, C++, Python and even a little bit of about x64 ISA.

In
the student project we did a mock-up interview with the client to get the requirements and analysis for the design
of the product. From there we worked as a team using the appropriate software
development methodology, while utilising a workflow board tool like Trello.

At
home I like to draw, design, write poems
etc as my hobby. I also manage my own business from there as well. I have two
nationalities Australia and an Asian country. I have a mixed background. Thus, you can get an idea then what home life is like and the
language spoken. One fact someone might find interesting about me is I can pull
my voice into the whistle register. Seeing I have birds also, you can see how I
come to try to mimic that sound.

Oh
I leave this section for you with this bonus poem in progress called Symphony
of the Valley- By Andrew Dauven(work in progress). Dedicated to those Disney
style symphonies of the bygone era.

I
walk as I walk in a place that is sweet.  
With natural beauty surrounding and plenty to eat.  
The flowers they bloom and give off a scent.  
All where I go in the valley that's meant  
To be a place for me to relax and all that I thought  
Yet that is only a sum of the things which I was taught  
For sooner or later an event surprised me well  
When up up and I rise in the valley so swell  
I was taken high up to hill that was tall  
Where I saw the valley teeming with life and all  
The grandeur of beauty fully for my eyes to behold  
A place that paints a picture for the young and the old  
For in the place what was about to occur  
Was a symphony of nature which was made to be heard  
The flowers and animals gather together in their space  
And echoes of melody, rhythm and harmony went out of this place  
As I articulated the movement with my hands  
So went forth me giving the orchestra with direction and plans

#Interest
in IT

My
interest in IT specifically concerning programming was when I started to realise what I wanted to do at that
time in the future for a job. This was during 2010 and in particular I was
accustomed to the C++ programming language and had knowledge of mark-up language. The event
that sparked my interest and curiosity was because of the whole idea of being
able to make something which you that doesn’t exist, plus the idea of 3d graphics.

With that said I want to outline in dot point form my IT experience so far. 
***Understand
of programming concepts from general topics like loops and conditional
statements to OOP concepts like classes and polymorphism. *Creating a desktop
app in C# for example and a web app with ASP.NET****. *Creating a custom branded installer *Played with Adruino
and its sensor, recording data from it
*Building a custom Discord bot with native development in Node JS and pm2 for
process monitoring. *Using SDLC like waterfall to Agile methodology like Scrum.
*Creating a document by authoring code with Doxygen and linking inside code to
a help file which I designed *Messed around with making a match three game
*Played with Linux like with Ubuntu,
Fedora etc *Using command line tools *Designing things with Visual Studio,
Eclipse, NetBeans etc *Databases like SQL
and Microsoft Access ...Also many more things.**

With experience with me, I decided to come to
RMIT to further my studies. I choice I do not regret. The reason I came to RMIT
is let's face it the name. You have R just in front of MIT. So you understand
why. Another reason why I come here is to be able to learn and grow as
personally and professionally as a person. On top of that I would say to
increase my position authoritatively by completing this bachelor’s degree. The last reason why I chose RMIT is so that I can
share my knowledge and experience from what I have learnt.

In
my studies I expect to refresh on what I know but be open minded to learning
new things pertaining to this field. The things I expect to learn are: ***Emerging
technologies *Further programming insights *AI development *Understanding my
role in IT and my responsibili****ties;
the WHS and ethics stuff *SDLC and project management**, like I learned before. As you can see these are just some of the examples of what I expected to learn
but not everything I need to learn. Some
are relating to what I know or think I might end up learning which could be new
in that which I know, but also in that which I didn't know before.

#Ideal
job

We
all know that it takes time to figure out what kind of ideal job we would like
to do. For me in particular, this job posting on indeed.com by Digital Native
for the role of a software developer who specialises in mobile development,
namely reactive native is appealing to me. The reason why I find this job
position appealing is that they utilise open source well documented and a cross
platform framework. Doing so simplifies my job having to only have one code
base for the ioS, Android etc, which makes deploying to that platform faster,
optimising productivity and the workflow. Another appealing factor about this
job post is that I will be developing for on-demand technologies, namely
utilising a growing mobile and portable devices market segment. Another reason why this is the ideal job is that this company values
in particular someone who takes the initiative to prepare clean
and well documented code that has been tested successfully. So, it gives a little
indication about the company culture. This is a plus because it shows that they
more likely care about writing beautiful code vs spaghetti code, to cause less
bugs to appear.

Since
we talked about that, let's now move onto the skills, requirements and
experience for this position. According to the job post, there are several
skills and experiences required for any applicant. These will be listed in dot
point form for more clarity.

***Experience
building web and mobile apps using up to date JavaScript while utilising a RESTFUL architecture. *API integration
*Experience in React Native or React experience and wanting to expand to React
Native *Having understood and deployed apps to the App/Play Store. *Likes to
keep code readable and well designed,
while making sure it's well tested *Can demonstrate to work in a team that
deals with vagueness everyday *Has experience with cloud services like Azure,
AWS, GCP etc**

At
current, for me personally when looking at above dot points is to say this. I
am at current familiar with the technologies
described here and want to learn more in
this direction. This is to add on my existing knowledge on building with Node JS, JavaScript experience, other web experiences like with html, css and
xml like syntax. I also am used to the REST architecture and understanding the
topic of the server and client and its roles and responsibilities towards each other. I have also had experience at current in writing clear code that is readable and have some experience with testing software, but I
believe I could learn more there. I have also had experience and understanding of agile methodology with the
concept of a sprint, as well as understanding of the traditional waterfall
model. From my time working as a team, I gained understanding on the SDLC and
how to ideate and test if the product is
safe for release. Lastly, I have
experience when it relates to the job posting with my skills in debugging;
finding bugs by stepping through the code. Overall on top of that I am a
software developer because I have a diploma in this field and skills lays in
developing software and general IT skills(Office, repairing windows etc). Yet not withstanding I also have design skills and that really helps a lot when it
comes to people centred design and what that job post really requires as well.

With
that said I still have things to learn to be able to land a job like that if I
was to pursue after it in the future. For
one thing I would need to practise my
skills at creating a react native app and follow along with videos and
tutorials online. I also need to practise my skills in Azure and other cloud
development skills by utilising free resources from the Azure, ASW or Google
cloud development sites. Lastly, I need to make sure to look into software patterns for
real-time mobile app development, while keeping in mind studying up and practising implementing on modern architecture, namely something like
microservices. These are all the things I would have to do to try to accomplish
my goal of getting that kind of job. Another thing to consider is to create a
portfolio which can be hosted on Github to showcase for the job application.
Yet most importantly no job would hire someone without some formal recognition; so for
me to show them my Diploma and also my Bachelor's
degree. Yet these days one word to note, you don't actually need to have a
degree and can get jobs with a diploma because the IT industry is lacking
people.

#Personal
Profile

To
try to understand myself better ahead of time concerning test that potential employees might get me to do, I did three different test. The
first one was the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator and for me in particular I used
the site 16 personalities to figure that out. As the result I was categorised
as an ENFP-A aka what they call the Assertive Campaigner. It tells me my role
as a diplomat and my strategy is in people mastery.

[](https://github.com/Artist-at-Work/My-Personal-Profile/blob/master/ENFP_detail.png)

Here
is also a link to my ENFP-A profile: https://www.16personalities.com/profiles/0eec63a29ccb1

There
are also two other test that I decided to do. One is a learning styles test. It placed me on the first order of
things as a visual learner. Second to that is auditory and lastly it placed me
for third as kinaesthetic learner. The
best result for the main and most important one is called visual learner and is given below.

[](https://github.com/Artist-at-Work/My-Personal-Profile/blob/master/Learning_styles.png)

Also here is the link to the full results for that test in
full: https://personalitymax.com/report/?mi=77-70-80-63-87-63-77-83&name_key=18fd706de1

Now
moving unto the final test which I had to perform, we will be looking at my
multi-intelligence test and its result.

[](https://github.com/Artist-at-Work/My-Personal-Profile/blob/master/Multiple_intelligence_test_report.png)

Here
is the link to the full test results: https://personalitymax.com/report/?ls=69-59-59&name_key=18fd706de1

Overall, what these results tell me about myself that I would have a
higher chance of influencing people and
that I am a creative at the same time. Yet also because it shows that I am an ENFP-A type
for my personality test result, it means I have people mastery as one of the number of things. This is
especially helpful when performing in a
team because it shows that I have the ability to lead a team it seems. Because
of this, it would influence my behaviour in a team in a positive way, but in particular as it shows that I as I would like to mention
again as a team leader.

**My project idea**

**MyHealth**

It's
so crucial in our life to understand fully how to effectively communicate with
each other. In a hospital environment, this is ever so critical because
miscommunication between healthcare professionals and patients can have a detrimental consequence even leading to deaths, with lawsuits
coming around the corner. It's not going to be a pretty picture then. Therefore, we created MyHealth.
It's a healthcare platform that is all about the administering of health care and monitoring of health care in real-time,
on the go or at home which pinpoints with more precision an accurate reading
for the patient, while helping both sides communicate more effectively through accurate data
and how to translate that date to make it easier for both to understand. This
is in overview form what MyHealth is about. For a deeper dive, keep reading as we explore the innerworkings of this project more in-depth. Come and join us for this interesting ride.

For
us why we embarked on this journey is because we want to do some charitable thing in this world by improving fundamentally the lives of
others. Doing so makes us feel good about ourselves and because we helped
others take better care of themselves. Who wouldn't imagine designing a system
that addresses the flaws given to poor communication between healthcare
professionals and their patients.

**Description**

This
product or service is in its infancy stage
and not in its alpha and beta version of
the application platform mode yet. Therefore, we try to address this topic from the perspective of what we are hoping to achieve from this in detail. The first
key part of all of this is that MyHealth uses a subscription based business model; in particular Saas(software as a service) .
We positioned it this way mainly because of the cost and storage of Big Data.
The cost licensing to make it cheaper and of course also the cost of maintence
and giving of iOT devices that more likely will be connected with the MyHealth
platform. The only thing that is not as a subscription to use is the hardware
supplied with the subscription. It will still work when the subscription for
the software runs out. Yet we also provide the flexibility of using existing
health tracking devices and using their API to take that data and translate it via
our machine learning process.

Speaking
of machine, we are happy to say that MyHealth uses machine learning to learn
user patterns and gives them suggestions and generates for them information. It
tells the patient about their medical problems in a way where medical
terminology is translated into lay people terms with analogies metaphors and
other literacy objects in the creative toolkit where necessary. For example, explaining the cell like a city which has various roles and functions moving
more towards that direction of thinking. After all it's time for the patient to
actually know what problem they are facing is and what treatment is going to be
administered by the healthcare professional to them etc.

By
successfully simplifying to the patient’s level of understanding, it makes it easier
for doctors who have difficulty with
explaining tricky concepts to finally explain it to them. This reduces stress
for both the patient and the healthcare professional. When it comes to the ioT devices and the MyHealth platform is
to say this. By increased advancement in sensor, mapping technologies and other
technologies. When we handle data, we
do the following. One little additional note to mention about the patient and
health care professional's end is this. Both side control data which they have
or had received from the other and have the choice if they want to send that
info to each other or not. While doing so, each of them has a different
interface to suit them. Lastly not to forget to mention when it comes to
policy, all data collected will be disclosed by the recipient over the data they chose. Any data collection will be
written in the MyHospital policy site and on the app, with a
prompt message explaining about data-collection. The
only thing MyHospital collects for
ourselves will be anonymous research data, which cannot define any person.

In
particular to address the following problems, which we will list in dot point
form-

**We
are trying to help strengthen the standard for health professionals concerning what is described above.

**Address
the problem that the patient finds hard to
understand concerning what their diagnosis
was or what medication they need after discharge.

**Improve
the patients communication with their healthcare professional concerning the
change in their needs and requirements, for example if their medication becomes
costing so much for them.

**Promote
on the platform the ability to freely ask questions in an open-ended way. To have healthcare
professionals during that time to be reflectively listening and as the result
also while listening show that they care by showing empathy.

**Minimalising
patients feeling not listened to by their doctor, which can hugely influence
them on being more with withdrawal to their healthcare professional

**Emphasising on mobility and accuracy of the monitorisation and healthcare administrating process, while keeping the
data secure.

**Tools and Technologies**

There
are various technology that can be used for the development of MyHealth, but
for us in particular, we chose to use opensource technology. Seeing that it's
easier and more beneficial to do so. Because our aim is to have mobility and
cross platform compatibility in mind, we
used React JS native for the GUI design and interaction. This will be used
alongside Node Js, a runtime framework.
Another technology which will be utilised is Socket IO. For the database we still figuring out how to go about it. We
believe it has to go on along the lines of Big data. Concerning the operating
system, it's cross-platform. One last thing for the hardware technology, we feel
first by looking at what open source technology on offer. For now, that is all we can think to say about the technologies and
tools we plan on using.

**Skills required**

For
this project to be accomplishable, a certain skillset is required as one can imagine, to achieve this goal which we have already or need to learn.
These are listed below-

****The
number one thing is a researched understanding into the marketplace of choice.  
**Ability to
establish the target audience and the behavioural demographic as a collective.

**Coding
in JavaScript and understanding mark-up language.

**Knowing
the basics of data science

**Understanding
how to utilise Node JS and React JS Native

**Knowing
about microservices and how to implement it

**Machine
learning is helpful with the AI side of translating and recommending certain features of MyHospital

**Outcome**

We
believe there will be much benefits of such a project if it was tested and
could be deemed by us as feasible. The outcome would be us having a clear and
concise improved way of administrating healthcare in the sense of
monitorisation, self-support emergency and
most importantly getting direct crucial updates between the patient and their
physician about any abnormal changes in
bodily function etc. As the result the service would be rolled out and plans would be to integrate existing devices and
MyHealth devices within the platform.

Creating
MyHealth solves existing problems by combining existing technologies with innovative design.
More specifically it helps more to equip patients with their healthcare
professional, by tailor made quoting the app for specific needs of each
individual. This allows then for a much more precise reading when it comes to
the accuracy in the reading of the information and as a result, that gives a
much better diagnosis and prognosis of the
situation. After all every one of us is different biologically in the way our
body response internally and how it response to external stimuli also.

As
the result with MyHealth, we will end up
streamlining with mobility the healthcare experience and make the lives of patients and their healthcare professionals more at ease,
while prioritising privacy and security in
the process. Not to mention most importantly accuracy of data for a much more appropriate way to administer the correct treatment. This in essence is
what this development will have.

#Personal
Profile

To
try to understand myself better ahead of time concerning test that potential employees might get me to do, I did three different test. The
first one was the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator and for me in particular I used
the site 16 personalities to figure that out. As the result I was categorised
as an ENFP-A aka what they call the Assertive Campaigner. It tells me my role
as a diplomat and my strategy is in people mastery.

Here
is also a link to my ENFP-A profile: https://www.16personalities.com/profiles/0eec63a29ccb1

There
are also two other test that I decided to do. One is a learning styles test. It placed me on the first order of
things as a visual learner. Second to that is auditory and lastly it placed me
for third as kinaesthetic learner. The
best result for the main and most important one is called visual learner and is given below.

Also here is the link to the full results for that test in
full: https://personalitymax.com/report/?mi=77-70-80-63-87-63-77-83&name_key=18fd706de1

Now
moving unto the final test which I had to perform, we will be looking at my
multi-intelligence test and its result.

Here

Overall, what these results tell me about myself that I would have a
higher chance of influencing people and
that I am a creative at the same time. Yet also because it shows that I am an ENFP-A type
for my personality test result, it means I have people mastery as one of the number of things. This is
especially helpful when performing in a
team because it shows that I have the ability to lead a team it seems. Because
of this, it would influence my behaviour in a team in a positive way, but in particular as it shows that I as I would like to mention
again as a team leader.

**My project idea**

**MyHealth**

It's
so crucial in our life to understand fully how to effectively communicate with
each other. In a hospital environment, this is ever so critical because
miscommunication between healthcare professionals and patients can have a detrimental consequence even leading to deaths, with lawsuits
coming around the corner. It's not going to be a pretty picture then. Therefore, we created MyHealth.
It's a healthcare platform that is all about the administering of health care and monitoring of health care in real-time,
on the go or at home which pinpoints with more precision an accurate reading
for the patient, while helping both sides communicate more effectively through accurate data
and how to translate that date to make it easier for both to understand. This
is in overview form what MyHealth is about. For a deeper dive, keep reading as we explore the innerworkings of this project more in-depth. Come and join us for this interesting ride.

For
us why we embarked on this journey is because we want to do some charitable thing in this world by improving fundamentally the lives of
others. Doing so makes us feel good about ourselves and because we helped
others take better care of themselves. Who wouldn't imagine designing a system
that addresses the flaws given to poor communication between healthcare
professionals and their patients.

**Description**

This
product or service is in its infancy stage
and not in its alpha and beta version of
the application platform mode yet. Therefore, we try to address this topic from the perspective of what we are hoping to achieve from this in detail. The first
key part of all of this is that MyHealth uses a subscription based business model; in particular Saas(software as a service) .
We positioned it this way mainly because of the cost and storage of Big Data.
The cost licensing to make it cheaper and of course also the cost of maintence
and giving of iOT devices that more likely will be connected with the MyHealth
platform. The only thing that is not as a subscription to use is the hardware
supplied with the subscription. It will still work when the subscription for
the software runs out. Yet we also provide the flexibility of using existing
health tracking devices and using their API to take that data and translate it via
our machine learning process.

Speaking
of machine, we are happy to say that MyHealth uses machine learning to learn
user patterns and gives them suggestions and generates for them information. It
tells the patient about their medical problems in a way where medical
terminology is translated into lay people terms with analogies metaphors and
other literacy objects in the creative toolkit where necessary. For example, explaining the cell like a city which has various roles and functions moving
more towards that direction of thinking. After all it's time for the patient to
actually know what problem they are facing is and what treatment is going to be
administered by the healthcare professional to them etc.

By
successfully simplifying to the patient’s level of understanding, it makes it easier
for doctors who have difficulty with
explaining tricky concepts to finally explain it to them. This reduces stress
for both the patient and the healthcare professional. When it comes to the ioT devices and the MyHealth platform is
to say this. By increased advancement in sensor, mapping technologies and other
technologies. When we handle data, we
do the following. One little additional note to mention about the patient and
health care professional's end is this. Both side control data which they have
or had received from the other and have the choice if they want to send that
info to each other or not. While doing so, each of them has a different
interface to suit them. Lastly not to forget to mention when it comes to
policy, all data collected will be disclosed by the recipient over the data they chose. Any data collection will be
written in the MyHospital policy site and on the app, with a
prompt message explaining about data-collection. The
only thing MyHospital collects for
ourselves will be anonymous research data, which cannot define any person.

In
particular to address the following problems, which we will list in dot point
form-

**We
are trying to help strengthen the standard for health professionals concerning what is described above.

**Address
the problem that the patient finds hard to
understand concerning what their diagnosis
was or what medication they need after discharge.

**Improve
the patients communication with their healthcare professional concerning the
change in their needs and requirements, for example if their medication becomes
costing so much for them.

**Promote
on the platform the ability to freely ask questions in an open-ended way. To have healthcare
professionals during that time to be reflectively listening and as the result
also while listening show that they care by showing empathy.

**Minimalising
patients feeling not listened to by their doctor, which can hugely influence
them on being more with withdrawal to their healthcare professional

**Emphasising on mobility and accuracy of the monitorisation and healthcare administrating process, while keeping the
data secure.

**Tools and Technologies**

There
are various technology that can be used for the development of MyHealth, but
for us in particular, we chose to use opensource technology. Seeing that it's
easier and more beneficial to do so. Because our aim is to have mobility and
cross platform compatibility in mind, we
used React JS native for the GUI design and interaction. This will be used
alongside Node Js, a runtime framework.
Another technology which will be utilised is Socket IO. For the database we still figuring out how to go about it. We
believe it has to go on along the lines of Big data. Concerning the operating
system, it's cross-platform. One last thing for the hardware technology, we feel
first by looking at what open source technology on offer. For now, that is all we can think to say about the technologies and
tools we plan on using.

**Skills required**

For
this project to be accomplishable, a certain skillset is required as one can imagine, to achieve this goal which we have already or need to learn.
These are listed below-

****The
number one thing is a researched understanding into the marketplace of choice.  
**Ability to
establish the target audience and the behavioural demographic as a collective.

**Coding
in JavaScript and understanding mark-up language.

**Knowing
the basics of data science

**Understanding
how to utilise Node JS and React JS Native

**Knowing
about microservices and how to implement it

**Machine
learning is helpful with the AI side of translating and recommending certain features of MyHospital

**Outcome**

We
believe there will be much benefits of such a project if it was tested and
could be deemed by us as feasible. The outcome would be us having a clear and
concise improved way of administrating healthcare in the sense of
monitorisation, self-support emergency and
most importantly getting direct crucial updates between the patient and their
physician about any abnormal changes in
bodily function etc. As the result the service would be rolled out and plans would be to integrate existing devices and
MyHealth devices within the platform.

Creating
MyHealth solves existing problems by combining existing technologies with innovative design.
More specifically it helps more to equip patients with their healthcare
professional, by tailor made quoting the app for specific needs of each
individual. This allows then for a much more precise reading when it comes to
the accuracy in the reading of the information and as a result, that gives a
much better diagnosis and prognosis of the
situation. After all every one of us is different biologically in the way our
body response internally and how it response to external stimuli also.

As
the result with MyHealth, we will end up
streamlining with mobility the healthcare experience and make the lives of patients and their healthcare professionals more at ease,
while prioritising privacy and security in
the process. Not to mention most importantly accuracy of data for a much more appropriate way to administer the correct treatment. This in essence is
what this development will have.
